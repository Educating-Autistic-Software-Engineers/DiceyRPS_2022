# Dicey RPS Game

These game assets were completed as part of the Summer 2022 EdASE Computer Game Coding Camp. Three campers worked to produce this game idea and these assets.

## Dicey RPS Idea
The premise of the game is that you, an adventurer, are challenged to an advanced game of rock, paper, scissors. This game of RPS is played with dice. In a timed environment, you must defeat your enemies through luck and skill to win. 

## Dicey RPS Assets
Unfortunately, there was not time to fully flesh out this game idea, but the campers made assets for the game! 

Camper 1 completed the Rock, Paper, and Scissors pixel art for the three dice sides. Additionally Camper 1 created the background image.

Camper 2 created the menu options and the Dicey RPS title.

Camper 3 created the music pieces for the game as well as icons for playing the game with sound or without.
